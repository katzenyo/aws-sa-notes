- Policy (JSON) document that can be attached to OUs, the root container, or AWS accounts
- Management account can't be restricted/affected by SCPs
	- Avoid using management account in prod
- SCPs are account permissions boundaries
- Limit what the account (including account root user) can do
- SCPs do not grant permissions, only control what an account can/can't do via [[IAM Identity Policies]]
- Can be used in two ways:
	- Allow List
	- Deny List
		- Much lower admin overhead
- Understand: effective permissions are the overlap between identity policies and applicable SCPs
