## Three Phase Approach

### Phase 1

- Identify easiest questions, do them first
	- Questions that can be answered in 10s or less, or low chance of mistakes

### Phase 2

- Identify the hardest questions, mark them, then skip past them
- Start working on the medium questions

### Phase 3

- Focus on the hard questions now
- Finish as many as possible in the time remaining
	- If running out of time, GUESS, EVEN AT RANDOM IF YOU HAVE TO
