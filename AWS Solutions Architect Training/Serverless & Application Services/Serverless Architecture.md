- Serverless is a software architecture - not one single thing
- Goal is to manage few, if any servers - reduce overhead
- Apps are a collection of small, specialized functions
	- Stateless, ephemeral environments
	- Billed for duration of function
- Event-driven
	- Consumed only when used
- FaaS is used where possible for compute functions
- Managed services used where possible
