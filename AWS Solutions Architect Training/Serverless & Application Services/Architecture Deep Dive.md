## Event-Driven Architecture

- No constant running or waiting for things to happen
- Producers generate events when something happens
	- Clicks, errors, criteria met, uploads, actions
- Events are delivered to consumers
	- Actions are taken and the system returns to waiting
- Mature event-driven architecture only consumes resources while handling events
