- NIST definition of cloud computing requires 5 characteristics:
	1. On-Demand Self-Service
		1. Provision/terminate capabilities as needed **without human interaction**
	2. Broad Network Access
		1. Capabilities are available over the **network**, on any device, and accessed through **standard protocols and methods.
	3. Resource Pooling
		1. **Location independence** with no **control or knowledge** over the exact **location** of the resources
		2. Resources are **pooled** to serve multiple consumers using a **multi-tenant model**
		3. Economies of scale, cheaper service
	4. Rapid Elasticity
		1. Capabilities (resources) can be **elastically provisioned** and **deprovisioned** to scale **rapidly** outward and inward with demand
		2. To the consumer, capabilities available for provisioning *appear* to be **unlimited**
		3. Scale up (out) and down (in) automatically in response to system load
	5. Measured Service
		1. Resource usage can be **monitored, controlled, reported, and billed**\
		2. Usage is measured, pay only for what you consume

>[!Important] Exam PowerUp!
> For every service introduced, evaluate which NIST characteristic that service demonstrates
